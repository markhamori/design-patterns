We are going to create an interface Expression and concrete classes implementing the Expression interface. A class TerminalExpression is defined which acts as a main interpreter of context in question. Other classes OrExpression, AndExpression are used to create combinational expressions.

InterpreterPatternDemo, our demo class, will use Expression class to create rules and demonstrate parsing of expressions.
