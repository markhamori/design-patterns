- The builder pattern allows us to create complex objects
piece by piece by creating a new instance of some object
with some baseline properties
- Then we can add properties to that object one by one

- The goal of the builder pattern is to separate an object's construction
from its representation

- We do not have to worry about specific syntax or specific order,
because the builder take away these problems from us
