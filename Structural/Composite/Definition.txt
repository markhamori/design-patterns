- Composite - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- A tree control is a perfect example of a Composite pattern. The nodes of the tree either contain an individual object (leaf node) or a group of objects (a subtree of nodes).

- All nodes in the Composite pattern share a common set of properties and methods which supports individual objects as well as object collections. This common interface greatly facilitates the design and construction of recursive algorithms that iterate over each object in the Composite collection.
