- Define a one-to-many dependency relationship
from one object known as the subject to many
other objects known as the observers

- These observers are functions, which watch the subject
and wait for some signal or trigger from the subject
before they run (like an event listener)

- It is useful and commonly used when it comes to creating
event handling systems
