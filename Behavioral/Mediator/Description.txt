- Allows to define an object known as the mediator
that encapsulate and controls how some set of
objects interact with each other

- Object send message -> to a mediator, it handles the complex logic
and routing, to decide where these messages need to go

- For example:A chatroom, it has members, these members need to
be able to send information, but they're not going to send
the messages directly to each other, they're going to send
the messages to a chat room object which is going to be the mediator
